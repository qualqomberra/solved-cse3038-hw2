<strong>Q.1</strong> – 4.6 from 5<sup>th </sup>edition (4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.6.3 included)

<strong>Q.2</strong> – 4.8 from 5<sup>th </sup>edition (4.8.1, 4.8.2, 4.8.3, 4.8.4, 4.8.6 included)

<strong>Q.3</strong> -We wish to add the instruction <strong>addi (add immediate) </strong>to the singlecycle datapath described in the chapter. Add any necessary datapaths and control signals to the single-cycle datapath of the Figure 4.24 which represents the datapath and show the necessary additions (if any) to the Figure 4.18 which represents the setting of the control lines.

<strong>Q.4. </strong>– Assume that you are required to extend  our single-cycle  MIPS implementation  so that it handles the “jnew” instruction, where “jnew” has R-type instruction format where rd field is 0.  An example is given below:

Example:<strong>  </strong>jnew   $s3, $s4     #  unconditionally jump to the address given  in

Memory[$s3+$s4]

#    PC← Memory[$s3+$s4]




<strong>Explain  your design</strong> by listing the required changes in  the complete single-cycle datapath clearly given in Figure 4.24 (additional wires, muxes and  control and selector signals if necessary).   <em> </em>
